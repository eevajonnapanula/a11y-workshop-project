# A11y-Workshop Demo Project

Note! Code of this repo has some serious accessibility problems on purpose, as it is used as a demo and template for a lecture. So don't look for code examples from this repository üòÅ

This project has been bootstrapped with Create React App, and is not beautiful. Some things have been on purpose, and some are just left there because I didn't want to use too much time when creating this project. So when you're forking this project, feel free to change whatever you want.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following packages installed:

- Node v. 14.x
- Yarn v. 1.22.x

## Getting Things Up And Running

First, fork the repository. You can find the fork button from the right upper corner of the repository page. You can find more detailed instructions from [Github's forking guide](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo).

After completing the steps, you should have the cloned repo on your computer. :tada:

Move into the cloned repository with

```
cd a11y-workshop-project
```
(or if you renamed the repo, use that name)

and install dependencies with

```
yarn
```

After that, everything should be fine, and you can start the project with

```
yarn start
```
